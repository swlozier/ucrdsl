UCR Digital Scholars Lab

This website is developed and maintained by Steve Anderson, a PhD Candidate in History at UC Riverside.
Steve is active in the digital humanities community, and he is currently the Graduate Student Researcher for the Scholars Lab. 
This website largely contains Steve's own notes and collections of documents while working on the project. 
Everything on this website is subject to change and reorganization. 
Hopefully this collection will help other researchers gain a quick foothold on the direction of the Lab during its initial stages.

Please send any questions, remarks, or comments!
